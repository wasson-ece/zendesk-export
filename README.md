# zendesk-export
## What is it?
A super simple Node application which downloads a complete copy of Zendesk data as JSON using their REST API.

## Why?
We needed to cancel Zendesk, but wanted to retain a copy of their database. CSV exports were determined insufficient as it would be difficult to process and doesn't handle attachements well; we wanted something we could potentially import again into another database and/or manipulate/search.


## Installation
1. Run `npm install`
2. Setup `config.json`

A `config.json` file must be created in the root directory of the app before running. An example file named `config-default.json` is included in the repository. This file contains an object with a Zendesk domain, username, and API token.

*Note: your API token can be found in `Settings > API` on the Zendesk dashboard.*

## Usage
1. Run `node index.js` or `nodemon`
2. Enter `{command} {parameter}` in the prompt

### Examples
* `users all` - saves all users
* `users 123` - saves user with ID 123
* `tickets all` - saves all tickets
* `tickets 123` - saves ticket with ID 123
* `orgs all` - saves all organizations
* `orgs 123` - saves organization with ID 123

You can download Users, Tickets and Organizations, either all at once or a specific ID. Each user and organization is contained in a separate JSON file. Tickets are stored in a folder with their Comments, Attachments, and Voice Recordings.

Regardless of method, data is exported as JSON files in the following structure and formats:

```
data/
    organizations/
        {organization.id}.json
    tickets/
        {ticket.id}/ticket.json
        {ticket.id}/
            {comment.id}/
                comment.json
                attachments/
                    {attachment.id}/
                        {attachment.file_name}
                recordings/
                    {recording.id}.mp3
    users/
        {user.id}.json

```
